 Bugs are to be reported through github issues and an issue is to be 
 claimed before resolving it. If an issue has been claimed but the one who
 claimed it has neither resolved it nor reported any progress via comments
 on the issue page within four weeks of claiming it, it is assumed that

 └─────────────────┘ <br />
1. A pull request that only adds a new game and does not change the 
   other files in any other way needs only 1 positive review.
2. Extremely minor edits like fixing a typo need no reviews and can be
   accepted by their own creator.
3. Larger edits that change already-existing files beyond merely adding
   a new game to the launcher must get 3 positive reviews or an okay from
   littlefiredragon or seat3542. If a pull request gets 3 negative reviews
   it is to be rejected.
