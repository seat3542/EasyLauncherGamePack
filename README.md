<h5>Bug Reports</h5>
<p>Bugs are to be reported through github issues and an issue is to be 
claimed before resolving it. If an issue has been claimed but the one who
claimed it has neither resolved it nor reported any progress via comments
on the issue page within four weeks of claiming it, it is assumed that
they have abandoned it and the bug is free to be claimed by someone else.</p>

<h5>Pull Requests</h5>
1. A pull request that only adds a new game and does not change the 
   other files in any other way needs only 1 positive review.
2. Extremely minor edits like fixing a typo need no reviews and can be
   accepted by their own creator.
3. Larger edits that change already-existing files beyond merely adding
   a new game to the launcher must get 3 positive reviews or an okay from
   littlefiredragon or seat3542. If a pull request gets 3 negative reviews
   it is to be rejected.

<h5>Testing</h5>
<p>All programs should be functional and complete before being added to the launcher. We expect they have been tested for major bugs. It should be ready for release. As such we have no policy on unittesting or anything of that nature, as there should be only minor bugs at worst. <br />
This project has been tested on:  </p>
<ul>
<li>openSUSE 13.1 64 bit</li>
</ul>
