Play the classic game Minesweeper. 
Avoid hitting the mines by deducing their locations from the numbers on the uncovered tiles.
Left click to uncover a tile and reveal how many mines border it. 
Right click a covered tile to flag it as a potential bomb. Right click again to remove the flag.
Once all non-bomb tiles are uncovered, you win!
